            <p>In this short, child-friendly platformer, you play as Sheepy, a young lamb who has gotten separated from his flock. Travel across prairies and through mountains to get home, and back to your family.</p>
            <p>There are mud slimes and hay slimes to avoid or fight, and rainbows to collect. It's possible to get through both levels without fighting.</p>

            <h2>Speedruns</h2>
            <p>This game has acqiured a small speed-run following, in the non-violent mode.Some updates have been made since these speedruns were done, fixing some issues.</p>

            <p>Sheepy! is free to download, and there are no in-game transactions.</p>  
            <p>If you're playing on Steam, there are two achievements possible: one to collect all the rainbows, and one to not kill any slimes.</p>
            <p>See if you can figure out how to tell when a slime is nearby. There's a "subtle" sign post.</p>
            <p>There are lots of caves to explore and steep cliffs, because the gameplay was inspired by ibexes leaping across steep mountains and climbing almost-shear dam faces. Sheepy can wall-jump, and double-jump, and slide down cliffs. He's a very bouncy sheep.</p> 
            <p>Watch for sheep-dogs. When you see them, you'll know Sheepy is getting close to home.</p>
